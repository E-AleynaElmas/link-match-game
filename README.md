# Link Match Game

A professional Unity match-3 style puzzle game built with clean architecture principles and performance optimizations.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Link Match is a tile-matching puzzle game where players connect chips of the same type to score points. The game features:
- Grid-based gameplay with customizable board sizes
- Target score system with move limits
- Smooth animations and visual feedback
- Responsive background system that adapts to different grid sizes
- Clean, professional UI with real-time score and move tracking

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Principles

### SOLID Principles Implementation

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **GameStateManager**: Exclusively handles score tracking and move management
- **LinkLineRenderer**: Only responsible for path visualization
- **BoardAnimationController**: Solely manages chip animations
- **HUDController**: Focuses purely on UI updates
- **ChipFactory**: Dedicated to chip creation and pooling

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **ILinkPathValidator**: Interface allowing different validation strategies
- **IFillStrategy**: Extensible fill algorithms
- **IShuffleStrategy**: Pluggable shuffle implementations
- **IChipFactory**: Abstraction for different chip creation methods

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All strategy interfaces can be swapped without breaking functionality
- Concrete implementations maintain contract integrity

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Focused interfaces like `ILinkPathValidator`, `IFillStrategy`
- No forced dependencies on unused methods

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level BoardController depends on abstractions (interfaces)
- Concrete implementations injected rather than directly instantiated

### Design Patterns

#### Strategy Pattern
```csharp
public interface ILinkPathValidator
{
    bool IsValidPath(IReadOnlyList<Coord> path, BoardModel model);
}

public interface IFillStrategy
{
    void FillBoard(BoardModel model, System.Random random);
}
```

#### Factory Pattern
```csharp
public interface IChipFactory
{
    Chip Spawn(ChipType type, Vector3 position);
    void Despawn(Chip chip);
}
```

#### Object Pool Pattern
- Chip instances are pooled for performance
- Reduces garbage collection pressure
- Improves frame rate stability

#### Observer Pattern
- Event-driven architecture using GameSignals
- Decoupled communication between systems
```csharp
public static class GameSignals
{
    public static event Action<int> OnScoreChanged;
    public static event Action<bool> OnGameOver;
}
```

#### Component Pattern
- BoardComponents class organizes related functionality
- Promotes composition over inheritance

#### Coordinator/Mediator Pattern
- BoardController coordinates between components
- Centralized game flow management

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Memory Management
- **Object Pooling**: Chip instances reused to minimize allocations
- **Cache-Friendly Data Structures**: Efficient lookup tables for chip palettes
- **Minimized Garbage Collection**: Reduced temporary object creation

### CPU Optimizations
- **O(1) Lookups**: Dictionary-based chip palette access instead of O(n) linear search
```csharp
// Before: O(n) linear search
public Sprite GetSprite(ChipType type) =>
    items.FirstOrDefault(item => item.type == type)?.sprite;

// After: O(1) dictionary lookup
public Sprite GetSprite(ChipType type) =>
    _itemLookup.TryGetValue(type, out var item) ? item.sprite : null;
```

- **Eliminated FindObject Calls**: Direct SerializeField references instead of runtime searches
- **Cached Component References**: Avoid repeated GetComponent calls
- **Efficient Animation System**: Coroutine-based animations with proper cleanup

### Unity-Specific Optimizations
- **Proper Unity Null Checks**: Explicit null checks instead of `?.` operator
- **SerializeField Usage**: Inspector-assignable references for better performance
- **Viewport-Based Scaling**: Efficient background scaling without gaps

## 🎨 Responsive Design System

### Camera Auto-Fit System
```csharp
public class CameraAutoFit : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void FitToBoard(int rows, int cols, float cellSize)
    {
        // Dynamic camera sizing based on grid dimensions
        // Maintains aspect ratio across different screen sizes
    }
}
```

### Background Scaling
- Viewport-based calculations eliminate visual gaps
- Automatic padding adjustment for different grid sizes
- Seamless integration with camera system

## 🎯 Game State Management

### Clean State Handling
- Immutable state transitions
- Event-driven updates
- Proper input blocking during animations
- Game over state management with visual completion

### Input System
- Clean separation between input detection and game logic
- Touch/mouse unified handling
- Busy state management prevents invalid interactions

## 🧪 Code Quality Measures

### Error Prevention
- Null reference protection throughout codebase
- Bounds checking for grid operations
- Defensive programming practices

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Self-documenting code structure
- Consistent naming conventions
- Modular architecture

### Testability
- Interface-based design enables easy mocking
- Pure functions where possible
- Minimal static dependencies
